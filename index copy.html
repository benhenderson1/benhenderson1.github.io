            <h3>About Me:</h3>
            <p>Hi! My name is Ben and I’m a 2nd year BSc Mathematics student at The University of Edinburgh.
            <h3>What I Am Offering:</h3>
              I’m offering online or in-person National 5 Maths tutoring, at a rate of £25 per hour.
            <h3>My Experience:</h3>
              During my last year of school at The Glasgow Academy, I voluntarily tutored a Higher Mathematics student and assisted within a Prep 7 Maths class weekly. Both of these experiences have benefitted my ability in listening to and understanding the student, as well as explaining different mathematical concepts which are core to progressing with maths.
            <h3>Get In Contact:</h3>
              If interested, please feel free to get in contact with me via my mobile, or the sign up form below.

            <blockquote>
              Ben's warm and friendly nature coupled with his excellent communication skills and in-depth understanding of mathematics make him an exceptional maths tutor. This year, Ben supported the delivery of the maths curriculum in a Prep 7 class. During Ben's weekly visit to the class, Ben would help reinforce concepts taught and support pupils who required extra consolidation of topics. Ben's patience and knowledge was warmly received by the pupils whom he supported; he built strong supportive relationships which helped pupils to progress with their learning. I have thoroughly enjoyed Ben's presence in the classroom and wish him the very best of luck with his future endeavours.- <cite>Prep 7 Teacher, The Glasgow Academy, 2023</cite>
